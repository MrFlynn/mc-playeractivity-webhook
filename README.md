## mc-playeractivity-webhook
This application reports inactive players on a given Minecraft server to a 
webhook periodically. The number of days a player is inactive, the frequency
with which to report those inactive players, as well as where to send the 
message (using a webhook) can all be configured in this program's `config.ini`.
